Hello, everyone!

The year is ending, so I thought I might want to have a personal website for the new year. And why not, a blog!

I don't know how much use I'm going to give to this thing, but it is nice having something where I can write stuff and share it with others if I want... and that is not some social media platform. 

The website and blog will probably change a lot. I've just deployed this using Eleventy, with the "eleventy-base-blog v9" template, because I wanted something working now, but I will be changing the looks of this and all that. Apart from the blog, I also want to use this to have my links instead of having them in something like a carrd, so that's another thing I need to do. And maybe I can use it to track what I read/play/watch/etc during the year somehow? I'll figure it out.

Ok, that's it! See ya!
